
Operators in Java

Operators are the symbols that is used to perform certain opearations.
Note that Operators will always act upon operands to perform a specific operation.
Based on the operand that the operator is acting upon operator are classified into three types.

1) Unary
     These are the operators that will act upon single opearand
2) Binary
	These are the operators that will act upon two operand
3) Ternary
	These are the operators that will act upon three operands
	
Types of Binary	operators
1)Arithmetic Operators
Example1: 

package operators;

public class Program1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// var is a keyword used to store dyanamic variables, var keyword automatically set the data depended on the value we gave.
		var a = 10;
		var b = 2;
		var c = a+b;
		var d = a-b;
		var e = a*b;
		var f = a/b;
		var g = a%b; 

		System.out.println("Addition result is "+c);
		System.out.println("Subtraction result is "+d);
		System.out.println("Multiplication result is "+e);
		System.out.println("Quotient result is "+f);
		System.out.println("Remainder result is "+g);
		
	}

}


package operators;

public class Program1 {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// var is a keyword used to store dyanamic variables, var keyword automatically set the data depended on the value we gave.
		var a = 10;
		var b = 2;
	/*	var c = a+b;
		var d = a-b;
		var e = a*b;
		var f = a/b;
		var g = a%b;  */

		System.out.println("Addition result is "+(a+b));
		System.out.println("Subtraction result is "+(a-b));
		System.out.println("Multiplication result is "+(a*b));
		System.out.println("Quotient result is "+(a/b));
		System.out.println("Remainder result is "+(a%b));
		
	}

}
